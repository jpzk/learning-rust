/*
This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: 
let, match, methods, associated functions, the use of external crates, and more.
In the next few chapters, youâ€™ll learn about these concepts in more detail. 
Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as 
variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. 
Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other 
languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains
how enums work.
